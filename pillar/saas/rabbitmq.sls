#   RabbitMQ clusters
#
#   Each cluster is defined by a deployment method (e.g. docker),
#   and the node we can use to configure it.
#
#   The cluster configuration is a collection of vhosts and users:
#
#   vhosts:
#     <vhost name>: <configuration>
#
#   users:
#     <user>: <password FULL secret path in Vault>
#
#     In addition, a root account is managed by deployment states.

#
#   The vhost configuration allows to define the exchanges and queues,
#   and the permissions users have on them.
#
#   exchanges:
#     type is 'direct', 'topic' or 'fanout'
#
#   queues:
#     Application can create their own ephemeral queue.
#     For that, it needs configure permission on the vhost.
#
#     If an application needs a stable one, it should be configured here,
#     so we can drop the configure permission.
#
#   permissions:
#     See https://www.rabbitmq.com/access-control.html#authorisation
#     for the needed permissions for an AMQP operation
#
#     To give access to server-generated queue names, use amq\.gen.*
#     To not give any access, use blank string

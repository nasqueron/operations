# Known issues

Bugs are documented on **DevCentral**, our Phabricator instance.

Issues specific to the Salt configuration are located at
https://devcentral.nasqueron.org/project/view/67/

More general servers issues are located are
https://devcentral.nasqueron.org/tag/servers/

This file documents the issues where the Salt states are generally correct
but where some situations can be troublesome, with the workaround to apply.

## Role: devserver

### PHP 5.6 <> PHP 7.x roulette

On FreeBSD, PEAR and composer pull PHP 5.6. As such, they will be skipped when
the state installs PHP 7.x. But if you run again the state, it will downgrade
to PHP 5.6.

**Workaround**

On FreeBSD, we currently install composer and phpcs manually. We also skip PEAR.

That forces to track explicitly Composer versions for hashes
in roles/shellserver/userland-software/base.sls file.

### pefs-kmod and FreeBSD 11

The pefs-kmod binary package is compiled against a version incompatible
with FreeBSD 11.1. See https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=221076

**Workaround**

Install pefs-kmod through ports (that requires /usr/src),
load the module, then require the module to be autoloaded
on boot.

```
$ cd /usr/ports/sysutils/pefs-kmod
$ make build deinstall reinstall
$ kldload pefs
$ grep -q pefs_load /boot/loader.conf || cat >> /boot/loader.conf
pefs_load="YES"
```

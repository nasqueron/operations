#   HSTS - HTTP Strict Transport Security
#
#   As we provide a Let's Encrypt certificate for all our services,
#   browser should be instructed to connect directly to HTTPS.
#
#   This is low risk, as the browser only honour this request
#   as soon as it successfully connected to HTTPS without any
#   certificate issue.

#   OCSP - Online Certificate Status Protocol
#
#   To improve TLS handshake speed, and to help protecting the
#   privacy of the users connecting here, as there isn't any need
#   for them to connect to the CRL anymore, OSCP is enabled.
#
#   The parameter `ssl_trusted_certificate` points to a bundle
#   of CA certificates, currently containing Let's Encrypt
#   intermediate and root certificates. If *any* certificate
#   is issued by another CA, their certificates must be added
#   to the bundle too.
